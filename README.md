# LINE ChatBot


## Introduction

There're two main files that I wrote for my chatbot. Both of them are under the folder 

sample-spring-boot-kitchensink/src/main/java/com/example/bot/spring/

	1. GuoPingController.java

	    The file for all the text, pushback data handling

	2. ProfileSupplier.java

	    The code for generating a flex profile page
	    
    
The QR code for the Guo Ping chatBot is:
